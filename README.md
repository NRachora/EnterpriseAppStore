Installation
---

We recommend you fork your own version of the system first, system works with some git submodules so please initialize with git submodules.

System is based on CakePHP 2.0 framework so please refer to the installation guide on http://www.cakephp.org.


Apart from that there is a few things you will have to do additionally.
1) Create your MySQL database
2) Import database files
3) Change database configuration in /web/app/Config/database.php
4) Change your Salt and cipherSeed codes in /web/app/Config/core.php (Please mind that changing these on a production server will fuck up your S3 folder structure as the system is using hash of these two values to generate base folders)
5) Set writable permissions for Apache to the following folders
   - /web/app/tmp/
   - /web/app/Userfiles/
   - /web/app/webroot/Userfiles/
6) You should be sorted !!!
